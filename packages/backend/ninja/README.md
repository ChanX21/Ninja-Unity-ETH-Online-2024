## How to run?

### Run using Node.js :rocket:

```bash

### Run using Docker :whale:

- Build the image using the following command:

```bash
# For Linux
docker build -t count:latest .

# For Mac with Apple Silicon chips
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t count:latest .
```

- Run the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
# If using SQLite as the datastore
docker run --env-file .env -v ./db.sqlite:/app/db.sqlite -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT> --name=count -it count:latest

# If using other URI based datastores
docker run --env-file .env -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT> --name=count -it count:latest
```

## Playground Plugin

To leverage examples and test the SDK, you can use Stackr's Playground hosted at: [https://playground.stackrlabs.xyz](https://playground.stackrlabs.xyz).

In you application, add Playground by importing the following:

```ts
import { Playground } from "@stackr/sdk/plugins";
 
const rollup = ...
await rollup.init();
 
Playground.init(rollup);
// this will start a server at http://localhost:42069, which is taken as input by the Playground
```
